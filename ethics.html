        <h1>Ethical Considerations in IT</h1>
        <p>Developers and IT professionals must adhere to ethical guidelines to ensure responsible technology use.</p>
        <h2>Key Guidelines</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Deepfake AI.</li>
            <li>Robotics and Ethics.</li>
            <li>Face Detection Technology.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Deepfake AI</h2>
        <p>
            Deepfake AI connects to IT ethics because it raises concerns about trust, privacy, and how it can be misused. For example, deepfakes can create fake videos or audio that look and sound real, which can spread lies, harm someone’s reputation, or trick people. It also brings up issues like using someone’s image or voice without their permission. To handle deepfake AI ethically, we need rules and tools to stop misuse while still allowing the technology to be used in helpful ways, like entertainment or education.
        </p>
        <h2>Robotics and Ethics</h2>
        <p>
            Robotics ties into IT ethics because it brings up big questions about who’s responsible when something goes wrong and how robots make decisions that affect people. For example, self-driving cars or healthcare robots have to handle tough choices, and we need to think about whether their actions are fair and safe. There’s also the issue of how robots might replace jobs or impact society in ways we’re not ready for. To use robotics ethically, we need to make sure they help people without causing harm or ignoring important human values.
        </p>
        <h2>Face Detection Technology</h2>
        <p>
            Face detection technology connects to IT ethics because it raises concerns about privacy, like tracking people without their knowledge or permission. It’s also important to think about how it’s used, since it could be misused or lead to unfair treatment. On top of that, the systems behind it can sometimes be biased, meaning they work better for some groups of people than others. To use this technology responsibly, we need to make sure it’s fair, transparent, and respects everyone’s rights.
